## Overview
### Routes
The `<path-router>` element is a custom element that allows you to show a single `<route-page>` element at a time, based on matching the `path` attributes. Here is a simple example:
```html
<path-router path="home">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about">About</route-page>
    <route-page path="/contact">Content</route-page>
</path-router>
```
In this example, the `<route-page>` with the `path` attribute set as "/home" will be visible. All other `<route-page>` children will be hidden using CSS.  
If the `<path-router>` element's `path` attribute was set to "about", the `<route-page>` with the `path` attribute set as "/about" would be visible, instead.

"Path Routers" are a common method of displaying only relevant parts of an app or website. By representing "where" a user is in your app or website using a "path", a wide variety of views can be supported with relatively simple configuration.

As demonstrated in the example above, it is trivial to show or hide content; the only requirement is to match the router's path to the route's path.

### Navigation
When the `<path-router>` element needs to display a different `<route-page>`, this can be achieved by "navigating" to a different path. Navigating is done by setting the `<path-router>` element's `path` attribute.

While updating the path is as simple as changing the attribute, a "navigation" is a full process that includes closing the currently open route - if one is currently open - and then opening the `<route-page>` element that matches the requested path. The entire process includes any css transitions set for the opening/closing routes, along with multiple events which can asynchronously block the process. 

The `<path-router>` element includes a `navigate` function which accepts a `path` string as its parameter. However, it is *not* required to use the `navigate` function; navigation will occur any time the `path` attribute is changed.  
Unlike changing the attribute directly, though, the `navigate` function is asynchronous and returns an awaitable Promise. This allow functionality to await the full navigation and transitions before occurring.

### Default Route
If the `path` attribute is left empty, the path router will not attempt to route. This allows initialization functionality to be applied before loading the initial route.  
If the `path` attribute is set to a string that cannot be matched to any `<route-page>` element's `path` attribute (see matching), the "Default" route will be loaded.

The "Default" route is determine by the following cascade:
- The last `<route-page>` element that has the `default` attribute will be set as the "Default" route. It is *expected* that there is only one default route, but multiples will just use the last `<route-page>` element.
- If no `<route-page>` element has the `default` attribute, the first `<route-page>` child in the `<path-router>` element will be used as the default route.

### Subrouting
In many cases, routing can benefit from "subroutes" which is just a label to describe putting a `<path-router>` element inside of a `<route-page>` element and using a single path to update both path routers. To help clarify, see this example:
```html
<path-router path="home">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about">About</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/app">About - This App</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/company">About - Company</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/mission">About - Mission</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/faq">About - FAQ</route-page>
    <route-page path="/contact">Content</route-page>
</path-router>
```
In this example, there are many routes that have the same prefix - "about". While this example will work just fine, it can often be inefficient to repeat content across several `<route-page>` elements. For example, if each of the "about" routes used a complex header, instead of just the word "About", all of that content would need to be duplicated for each route.

To simplify, the above example can be rewritten like this:
```html
<path-router path="about/mission">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/:subroute">
        About - 
        <path-router>
            <route-page path="app">This App</route-page>
            <route-page path="company">Company</route-page>
            <route-page path="mission">Mission</route-page>
            <route-page path="faq">FAQ</route-page>
        </path-router>
    </route-page>
    <route-page path="/contact">Content</route-page>
</path-router>
```
In this updated example, you can see that all of the routes whose `path` attributes were prefixed with "about" have now been moved into a nested `<path-router>` element, and had their "about" prefixes removed.  
From the top `<path-router>` element, the path is set to go to the top level route of "about" and then to the "subroute" of "mission". This causes the top `<path-router>` element to be routed to the `<route-page>` with the "/about" `path` attribute, and the nested `<path-router>` element to be routed to the `<route-page>` element with the "mission" `path` attribute.

Note that in order to use subrouting, the `<route-page>` with the "/about" `path` attribute includes a route property named ":subroute". It is named ":subroute" in the example, for clarity, but the route property name can be anything. The route property is used for matching, as a way to differentiate between this example:
```html
<path-router path="about/unknown-path">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about/:subroute">About - The one and only</route-page>
</path-router>
```

and this example:
```html
<path-router path="about/unknown-path">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/about">About - The one and only</route-page>
</path-router>
```
In the first example, the `<route-page>` element with the "about" `path` attribute should be displayed. This is because the "about" route will set the top level `<path-router>` element to show the `<route-page>` element with the "about" `path` attribute, while the "unknown-path" subroute should cause a nested `<path-router>` element to use its "default" path. In this example, there is no nested router, so the about page will simply be displayed and provide "unknown-path" to javascript as a route property.

In the second example, however, the `<route-page>` element with the "home" `path` attribute should be displayed because we have not defined the `<route-page>` element with the "about" `path` to have any subroutes. Since there is no `<route-page>` element that can match the requested path, the top level `<path-router>` element will open its default `<route-page>` child.

### Route Properties
Route Properties are a way to allow multiple path strings to match the same path.

Route Properties are defined by using a slug prefixed with the `:` character:
```html
<route-page path="user/:id"></route-page>
```
In this example, a route property named "id" is defined. Any url-safe string can be used as a route property name, including strings with hyphens.

### `router.getProperties()`
Any property that is defined by a `<route-page>` will be accessible in javascript by using the provided `getProperties` function. This function returns an object of key/value pairs that uses the defined property as a key, and the requested value from the `<path-router>` element's `path` attribute, as the value. For example:
```html
<path-router path="/user/21/contact/gw2ozjh">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/user/:userId">
        User
        <path-router>
            <route-page path="profile">Profile</route-page>
            <route-page path="contact/:contactId">Contact</route-page>
        </path-router>
    </route-page>
</path-router>
```
In this example, the `getProperties` function will return an object with a property named `userId` set to `21`, and a property name `contactId` set to `gw2ozjh`.

## `route-link` and `route-button` Elements
In order to navigate the `<path-router>` element without having to use javascript directly, this library provides two helper elements that can trigger a navigation event when they are clicked. Both elements function the same, using the `path` attribute to target a route.

### `is` attribute
Both the `route-link` and `route-button` elements are extensions of existing `HTMLElement`s, so they need to be invoked using the `is` parameter, rather than by using their custom identifiers as the tag names. Here is an example of each:
```html
<a is="route-link"></a>
<button is="route-button"></button>
```
Note that these identifiers are *not* interchangeable. A button with an `is` attribute of `route-link` (or vice versa) will just be a normal `HTMLElement` and will not dispatch a navigation event.  
And, just to state this explicitly: trying to use `<route-link>` or `<route-button>` will *not* work. Those tags will be rendered in most browsers as simple `<div>` elements.

### `path` attribute
The `path` attribute for these elements defines the exact path that you would like to open. Unlike the `path` attribute for `<route-page>` elements, this `path` attribute is not used for matching or in any other dynamic way. Whatever is provided as the string in the path will be what the `<path-router>` element's `path` attribute will be set to.
```html
<button is="route-button" path="user">Users List</button>
<button is="route-button" path="user/oiugx">Specific User</button>
<!-- Dynamic Content Example:
<button is="route-button" path="user/:id/contact">User Contacts</button>
This would route to the literal string of "user/:id/contact", without replacing the route-property. This can be supported by handling events with javascript, but wouldn't be an expected path if you did not plan to inject the route-property value.
 -->
```

There is a way to inject dynamic content into the provided `path` attribute of a `route-link` or `route-button` element, but that *requires* a javascript function to execute, so it is not possible to use these elements dynamically without some javascript intervention.

### `target` and `for` attributes
These elements need a `<path-router>` to invoke their navigation events on, so the `for` and `target` attributes are used for selecting that router.

These attributes are optional. If no selector is provided by either of these attributes, the `route-link` and `route-button` elements will default to targeting the first selectable `<path-router>` element in the document.

If the `for` attribute is provided, the link will select a router that has an `id` attribute which matches the `for` value. For example:
```html
<a is="route-link" for="my-router">User</a>
<path-router id="my-router">{...}</path-router>
```
Note that a "hash" character is not needed. This attribute mimics the functionality of the `<label>` element, when targeting an input.

If the `target` attribute is provided (and the `for` attribute is *not* provided), the link will select a router that matches the value of the attribute as a css selector. For example:
```html
<a is="route-link" target="#my-router">User</a>
<a is="route-link" target=".secondary-router">User</a>
<a is="route-link" target=".optional > path-router">User</a>
<path-router id="my-router">{...}</path-router>
<path-router class="secondary-router">{...}</path-router>
<div class="optional">
    <path-router>{...}</path-router>
</div>
```
Note that the `target` attribute requires you to provide a "hash" character if selecting by an id, because that's how the CSS selector works.  
Also note that complex CSS selectors may be used as `target` attribute values.

### `onPreparePath` event
In order to support dynamic navigation with minimal additional javascript for implementing developers, these elements dispatch an `onPreparePath` event that allows the implementing developer to transform the path value before that path is used to navigate the `<path-router>` element.

By setting the `onPreparePath` property, developers can define a function that takes in a path `string` parameter, and returns a `string` value that will be used as the new path.

Here is an example of a common use-case:
```html
<button is="route-button" path="user/:id/contact">User Contacts</button>
<path-router>{...}</path-router>
<script>
    document.querySelector('path-router').onPreparePath = (path: string) =>
    {
        if(path.indexOf(':id') > -1)
        {
            const userId = getUserIdFromCurrentUrl();
            if(userId > -1)
            {
                path = path.replace(":id", userId);
            }
        }
        return path;
    }
</script>
```
In this example, we take in the path that the button is routing to, which includes an `:id` route property, and then we transform it by replacing the `:id` route property with a value we have predetermined as the user's id. Then, by returning the new path with the id, the `<path-router>` will be navigated to a non-dynamic path with no undefined route properties.

## Dialog Routes
In addition to the `<route-page>` elements, the `<path-router>` element supports a secondary layer or routing that allows for `<dialog>` elements to be used as special-case routes within the router.

This "second layer" has some unique qualities which are based on common use-cases for dialogs that are also application routes. The most obvious difference is that routing to a dialog will *not* navigate away from the currently open `<route-page>` element. This means that opening a dialog does not dispatch any of the current `<route-page>` element's "close" events, and the curent page stays visible, behind the open dialog.  
This functionality is due to the common use-case of having a dialog open above the current content, rather than replacing current content.

Not all `<dialog>` elements should be routes. A user notification, or a status message may not need to be involved with routing, at all.  
Some `<dialog>` elements, though, do have some expectations of routing, while still maintaining all of the expectations for dialogs. An example of this would be an "App Configuration" dialog. These options may need to be available anywhere else within your app. And you may want to be able to return users directly to this current path, with the configuration open to where they had last left it.  
Given both of these expectations, a standard `<route-page>` element would introduce clunky management, while a standard `<dialog>` element would have to be handled separately, with bespoke functionality, in order to achieve the result.

To make this easier, a `route-dialog` element can be used. Since a `route-dialog` element is an extension of a standard `<dialog>` element, it must be invoked using the `is` parameter, rather than by using the custom element name as its tag.
```html
<dialog is="route-dialog" path="config">Config</dialog>
```

Routing to a `route-dialog` element uses the same `path` attribute for the `<path-router>` element, but is separated from the `<route-page>` path by a "hash" character (`#`).  
Subrouting and route properties all work the same as with `<route-page>` paths. All text before the "hash" character is used as the `<route-page>` path, and all text after the "hash" character is used as the `route-dialog` path. 
```html
<a is="route-link" path="#config">Config</a>
<path-router path="/home#config">
    <route-page path="/home">Home</route-page>
    <route-page path="/user/:userId">User</route-page>
    <dialog is="route-dialog" path="config">Config</dialog>
</path-router>
```
In this example, the "Home" `<route-page>` would be opened with the "Config" `route-dialog` opened on top of it.  
Note that the `route-link`'s `path` includes the hash to indicate that it is routing to a dialog, rather than a page. `route-link` and `route-button` elements can also include paths for both `<route-page>`s and `route-dialogs` at the same time: `<a is="route-link" path="user#config">Open Config on User page</a>`

## Transitions
During navigation, the `<route-page>` and `route-dialog` elements dispatch the following events:
- `beforeopen`
- `afteropen`
- `beforeclose`
- `afterclose`

Each of these events can be handled with by using the `addEventListener` function, or by using the `addBlockingEventListener` function. For example:
```js
document.querySelector('route-page[path="/home"]').addEventListener('beforeopen', (customEvent) =>
{
    console.log('This will log before the "home" route is opened');
});
document.querySelector('route-page[path="/user"]').addEventListener('afteropen', (customEvent) =>
{
    console.log(`This will log after the "user" route's css transition has finished.`);
});
document.querySelector('route-page[path="/home"]').addBlockingEventListener('beforeclose', async (customEvent) =>
{
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log('This will prevent the "home" route from closing for 1 second, whiel the above promise is awaited.');
});
```
### Attributes
To indicate specific stages of each transition, data attributes are added to, and removed from, the `<route-page>` and `route-dialog` elements during transitions.

Before a route is opened, it will be assigned the `data-entering` attribute. This attribute is removed when the route has been assigned the `open` attribute.  
Before a route is closed, it will be assigned the `date-exiting` atttribute. This attribute is removed after the route has had it's `open` attribute removed.

### Animations
By default, the routes are styled to allow for any type of CSS `transition` or `animation` effect to be awaitable by the transition. This means that if you have an `afteropen` event, and that route has a 2 second animation, the entire animation will play before the `afteropen` event is dispatched. This kind of functionality is useful for triggering events on the newly opened route - like when to start its children's animations.

## Styling
These custom elements do not use a shadow DOM, so they can be styled like any other element. Some default styles have been applied to account for transitions, but these styles can be overridden as ususal with CSS.

### Grid Display
In order to facilitate transitions, a grid display is used on the `<path-router>` element so that all of its children can be stacked in a single row and column. Unlike a `position` value of `absolute`, this allows the children to set the `auto` size of the router and expands all children to the same width and height as the largest child.

This display allows transition effects to be based on a single route size and have the same behavior for operations like rotation and scaling.

### `visibility` instead of `display`
The common practice of having a visual element "fade in" or "fade out", from transparent to opaque and back, has legacy support issues with using the `display` property while trying to control the transparency. 

To circumvent these issues, `<route-page>` elements set the `visibility` property rather than the `display` property when a route has been opened or closed. While this does not have much affect on other animations, any animations that expect the element's opacity to animate will be able to do so without issues around visual pop-in or premature event dispatches for `after` events.

### Themes
For convenience, three basic themes have been included in the library to set some very simplistic structures and colors on the library's elements. None of the elements require these themes to function or to be displayed in a useable way in the browser. These are mainly provided so that a designer can have a reference for how elements are targeted by selectors.

#### Tabs Theme
This theme styles an element that contains `route-link` elements, as well as its `route-link` children to look like an inline set of tabs which can be placed on top of the `<page-router>` element to appear as if the user is switching between a stack of tabbed documents. Here is an example of applying the `tabs` theme:
```html
<menu>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-tabs" data-theme="tabs" path="a">Route A</a>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-tabs" data-theme="tabs" path="b">Route B</a>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-tabs" data-theme="tabs" path="c">Route C</a>
</menu>
<path-router id="theme-tabs" data-theme="tabs" path="">
    <route-page path="a">Route A</route-page>
    <route-page path="b">Route B</route-page>
    <route-page path="c">Route C</route-page>
</path-router>
```

#### Sidebar Theme
This theme styles an element that contains `route-link` elements, as well as its `route-link` children to look like a list of menu items which can be placed on the left or the right of the `<page-router>` element to appear as if the user is switching between pages corresponding to options defined in the menu. Here is an example of applying the `sidebar` theme:
```html
<div class="container" style="display:flex;">
    <menu>
        <a is="route-link" for="theme-sidebar" data-theme="sidebar" path="a">Route A</a>
        <a is="route-link" for="theme-sidebar" data-theme="sidebar" path="b">Route B</a>
        <a is="route-link" for="theme-sidebar" data-theme="sidebar" path="c">Route C</a>
    </menu>
    <path-router id="theme-sidebar" data-theme="sidebar" path="">
        <route-page path="a">Route A</route-page>
        <route-page path="b">Route B</route-page>
        <route-page path="c">Route C</route-page>
    </path-router>
</div>
```

#### Heading Nav Theme
This theme styles an element that contains `route-link` elements, as well as its `route-link` children to look like an inline header menu of links.  
Additionally, the `<page-router>` element will be styled to include a border and a maximum width that adheres to a common maximum width for webpage display.  
Together, the links and the router resemble a popular page template design.
Here is an example of applying the `heading-nav` theme:
```html
<menu>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-heading-nav" data-theme="heading-nav" path="a">Route A</a>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-heading-nav" data-theme="heading-nav" path="b">Route B</a>
    <a is="route-link" for="theme-heading-nav" data-theme="heading-nav" path="c">Route C</a>
</menu>
<path-router id="theme-heading-nav" data-theme="heading-nav" path="">
    <route-page path="a">Route A</route-page>
    <route-page path="b">Route B</route-page>
    <route-page path="c">Route C</route-page>
</path-router>
```

## Browser History and URL updates
The `<path-router>` element **DOES NOT** make changes to the browser's URL in any way. It does not access the `window`'s `location` property, and does not interface with the browser's `History` API. While it is common practice for front-end routers to modify a user's URL, this library does not include that functionality.

The `<path-router>` element does include helper functions to facilitate modifying the browser's URL and History, but those functions must be invoked by the implementing developer, and the results of them must be parsed and applied to the browsers URL/History manually. 

In most cases, updating the browser history or url can be done by handling the `pathcompose` event and comparing the current url to the target url, like in this example:
```js
pageRouter.addEventListener('pathcompose', pageRouter_onPathCompose);
function pageRouter_onPathCompose(event)
{
    // prevent changing the url using events from subrouters
    if(event.target != pageRouter) { return; }

    // if we're moving back or forward,
    // we don't want to record that in history
    // and the browser will update the url
    if(historyIsUpdating == true) { return; } 
    
    const currentLocation = window.location;
    let updatedPath = pageRouter.getAttribute('composed-path');
    const origin = window.location.origin;
    const updatedLocation = new URL(origin + updatedPath);

    const { hasChanged, isReplacementChange } = pageRouter.compareLocations(currentLocation, updatedLocation);
    if(hasChanged)
    {
        if(isReplacementChange)
        {
            window.history.replaceState(null, '', updatedLocation.href);
        }
        else
        {
            window.history.pushState(null, '', updatedLocation.href);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example, we listen for the `pathcompose` event and then use the `compareLocations` feature to determine the details of how our navigation state has been changed.  
Once the navigation events are understood, the browser's history is updated by either replacing the current state, if we want to preserve the back function as an close command for a dialog, or by adding a new history entry if we want the back function to navigate us back to our previous route.


### Dialog Routing History
In many cases, it is expected that while a dialog may be routed to, any "back" or "previous" navigations called (usually by the browser's back button, or a mobile device's back button) should close the dialog rather than strictly route backward through the app router's history.  

This may seem counterintuitive - and you may not want this functionality for your app! - but it's a common pattern. To help contextualize it, you can think of an app that has a "config" dialog and a "user account" dialog, each which can be opened from anywhere in the application. If a user navigates from the "config" dialog to the "user account" dialog and then refreshes the page, they could expect to be returned to the "user account" page. But if they want to "close" that dialog by using the "back" button on their mobile OS, that action wouldn't work. Instead, they would be routed back to the "config" dialog, which may be confusing. 

As seen in the example above, this unexpected behavior can be avoided by replacing the history state, rather than adding an entry to it, whenever navigating from one dialog route to another.


### History and URL Notes
This "facilitation without implementation" is due to the complex nature of app navigation state and this library's adherence to the principle that the developer building the app would know *best* how to handle this state, and that a library should not try to do operations that it is not *best* suited to handle.

In a router, this is complicated because, while the app developer knows *best* about navigation state, the router knows *best* how a navigation occurred. This forces the implementing dev to first make the navigation occur, and then get a report about what occurred during that navigation, so they can use that report to set the appropriate state based on what happened.

More simply, the implementing dev should only have to provide a path. So it's a complicated task to take in a path and then provide the specific information that a dev would need to determine what the actual navigation outcome of providing that path is. In simple cases, this is trivial, but when you add in the "second layer" of dialog routes, subrouting, and the complications of route properties in a path, there are more things for an implementing dev to manage than just where the app's navigation state was and where it is now.

This library has tried to whittle things down to two key pieces of info: a single, compiled version of the path that represents a combination of all routers' and subrouters' paths, and whether or not the navigation occurred from one dialog route into another dialog route.

With these two pieces of information, history can be tracked in a robust way that allows for the common use-cases of closing a dialog when a "back" action is taken (either with the browser button or a mobile OS's button).

The advantages of this strategy allow impementing devs to give their users the option of whether or not to allow the app to set the browser's history, and it prevents devs from having to turn off functionality that they aren't interested in.
